# GoBooK
This is a book listing app which allows a user to get a list of published books on a given topic.
I used google books api to fetch results and display them. 
I also used Picasso to load the uri image into my imageview.
This project is about me combining various ideas and skills i have learnt, such as:
  1. Fetching data from an API
  2. Using an AsyncTaskLoader
  3. and Parsing a JSON response.
